# How to Run the Black Hole Time Waves Simulation

This document explains how to run the **black hole time wave simulation** on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `pip` for package management

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/black-hole-time-waves.git
cd black-hole-time-waves
2,    Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

    Run the Simulation

python scripts/black_hole_time_waves.py

Simulation Results

Once the simulation runs, you should see a plot representing the time waves and feedback loops in black holes. The results demonstrate the dynamic relationship between time, entropy, and spacetime curvature.

# Future Directions for Black Hole Time Waves Theory

This section outlines the next steps for exploring and expanding the **time wave theory** and its implications.

## **Ongoing Research**
- **Testing the Time Release Mechanism**: Simulating how black holes release time and impact cosmic evolution.
- **Exploring the Impact on Dark Energy**: Investigating if the **time release** mechanism can explain **accelerating expansion** without the need for dark energy.
- **Quantum Effects**: Exploring how quantum fluctuations are influenced by **time waves** and how they affect **particle behavior**.

## **Collaborative Efforts**
We are actively seeking collaborations with researchers interested in:
- Expanding the mathematical model,
- Testing these ideas in observational astronomy, and
- Exploring further **cosmological implications**.
