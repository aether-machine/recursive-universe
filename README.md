# 📜 Recursive Universe Model: Unifying General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics

## 🌌 Overview
This project explores a **new theoretical framework** that unifies **general relativity, quantum mechanics, and cosmic evolution** by proposing that **time, light, and matter are fundamentally interconnected and cycle through different states**.

## 🔬 Key Findings
### 1️⃣ Matter as "Trapped Light"
- Matter and energy are not distinct but instead exist in a **recursive transformation** driven by time.
- This aligns with known **pair production** experiments where photons create matter and antimatter.

### 2️⃣ Gravity as a Feedback Mechanism
- Instead of a fundamental force, **gravity may emerge from energy redistribution** across spacetime.
- Einstein’s **field equations** are modified to include a **time-dependent energy feedback term**:
  
  ```math
  G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} \left( T_{\mu\nu} + \frac{\partial E}{\partial t} \right)
  ```
  
- This removes singularities and suggests **black holes recycle energy** instead of leading to infinite curvature.

### 3️⃣ Black Holes Sustain the Steady-State Universe
- Instead of being one-way information sinks, black holes may function as **energy recyclers**, feeding the cosmic equilibrium.
- This may help resolve the **information paradox** and eliminate the need for "dark matter" corrections.

### 4️⃣ Dark Energy as an Emergent Process
- Instead of an unknown force, cosmic expansion might be a **natural oscillation** in the recursive energy cycle.
- A **dynamic cosmological constant** is introduced:
  
  ```math
  \Lambda(t) = \Lambda_0 e^{-t / \tau}
  ```
  
- This could explain accelerating expansion **without requiring exotic dark energy**.
