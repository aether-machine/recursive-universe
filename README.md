Light-Time-Matter Theory
A New Expansion of General Relativity Based on Kozyrev’s Ideas

🌀 What if time is not passive, but an active driver of energy? What if light and matter are part of a self-sustaining cycle? This project explores a new steady-state model of the universe where light, matter, and time are dynamically interconnected.
🌌 Key Concepts

    Matter as "Trapped Light": Mass emerges from constrained photons.

    The Sun as a Time Engine: Time is converted into energy (Kozyrev).

    A Steady-State Universe: No singularity, just an ongoing cycle of conversion.

    A Natural Feedback System: Explains cosmic energy balance.

## 📜 Core Equations  

1. **Light-to-Matter Conversion**  
   $dM = \tau(T) dE$  

2. **Time-Driven Energy Flow**  
   $\frac{dE}{dT} = \alpha T$  

3. **Matter Decay into Radiation**  
   $\frac{dM}{dS} = -\beta M$  

4. **Cosmological Equilibrium Condition**  
   $\Lambda(T) \propto \frac{E}{M}$  

### **Steady-State Condition**  
At equilibrium:  
$$  
\frac{dE}{dT} + \frac{dM}{dS} = 0  
$$  

🧪 Simulations

We have Python models to:

    Simulate light-to-matter transitions.

    Show how time affects energy production.

    Compare predictions to real astrophysical data.
