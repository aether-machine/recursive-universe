Light-Time-Matter Theory
A New Expansion of General Relativity Based on Kozyrev’s Ideas

🌀 What if time is not passive, but an active driver of energy? What if light and matter are part of a self-sustaining cycle? This project explores a new steady-state model of the universe where light, matter, and time are dynamically interconnected.
🌌 Key Concepts

    Matter as "Trapped Light": Mass emerges from constrained photons.

    The Sun as a Time Engine: Time is converted into energy (Kozyrev).

    A Steady-State Universe: No singularity, just an ongoing cycle of conversion.

    A Natural Feedback System: Explains cosmic energy balance.

    Light-to-Matter Conversion
    dM=τ(T)dEdM=τ(T)dE

    Time-Driven Energy Flow
    dEdT=αTdTdE​=αT

    Matter Decay into Radiation
    dMdS=−βMdSdM​=−βM

    Cosmological Equilibrium Condition
    Λ(T)∝EMΛ(T)∝ME​

Steady-State Condition

At equilibrium:
dEdT+dMdS=0
dTdE​+dSdM​=0

🧪 Simulations

We have Python models to:

    Simulate light-to-matter transitions.

    Show how time affects energy production.

    Compare predictions to real astrophysical data.

    Physicists, mathematicians, and programmers welcome!

    We need help refining equations and running simulations.

    See CONTRIBUTING.md for details.

🚀 Let’s redefine our understanding of the universe.
