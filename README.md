# Black Hole Time Waves Simulation

This project explores a **new theoretical framework** that unifies **general relativity**, **quantum mechanics**, and **cosmic evolution** by proposing that **time, light, and matter are fundamentally interconnected and cycle through different states**.

## üåå Overview

### **Key Theoretical Findings**:
- Matter is not distinct from energy; both exist in a **recursive transformation** driven by time.
- **Gravity** may emerge from **energy redistribution** across spacetime, not as a fundamental force.
- **Black holes** recycle cosmic energy and play a key role in maintaining cosmic equilibrium, supporting the **steady-state universe** model.

## üî¨ Key Insights
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Matter as "Trapped Light"
- **Matter and energy** are fundamentally interconnected, subject to a **recursive transformation**.
- Known phenomena like **pair production** demonstrate the transformation of **photons into matter**.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Gravity as a Feedback Mechanism
- Instead of gravity being a fundamental force, it may emerge from energy redistribution across spacetime.
- The Einstein field equations have been modified to include a **time-dependent energy feedback term**, removing singularities and allowing black holes to recycle energy.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Black Holes Sustain the Steady-State Universe
- Black holes are not simply **information sinks** but act as **energy recyclers**, stabilizing the cosmos.
- This helps resolve the **information paradox** and negates the need for **dark matter**.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Dark Energy as an Emergent Process
- **Cosmic expansion** may be driven by natural oscillations within the energy cycle, not requiring exotic forces like **dark energy**.

## **Theoretical Work to Date**:
1. **Time Propagation via Black Holes**: Black holes are theorized to release **time** as a dynamic quantity. This time release alters spacetime and allows for the **emergence of dark energy**.
2. **Gravitational Feedback**: The dynamics of spacetime curvature are altered by feedback loops involving **time release** and **entropy**, leading to a **self-regulating** cosmological system.
