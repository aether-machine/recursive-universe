A New Expansion of General Relativity Based on Kozyrev’s Ideas

🌀 What if time is not passive, but an active driver of energy? What if light and matter are part of a self-sustaining cycle? This project explores a new steady-state model of the universe where light, matter, and time are dynamically interconnected.
🌌 Key Concepts

    Matter as "Trapped Light": Mass emerges from constrained photons.

    The Sun as a Time Engine: Time is converted into energy (Kozyrev).

    A Steady-State Universe: No singularity, just an ongoing cycle of conversion.

    A Natural Feedback System: Explains cosmic energy balance.

📜 Core Equations

    Light-to-Matter Conversion
    dM=τ(T)dE
    dM=τ(T)dE

    Time-Driven Energy Flow
    dEdT=αT
    dTdE​=αT

    Matter Decay into Radiation
    dMdS=−βM
    dSdM​=−βM

    Cosmological Equilibrium Condition
    Λ(T)∝EM
    Λ(T)∝ME​

🧪 Simulations

We have Python models to:

    Simulate light-to-matter transitions.

    Show how time affects energy production.

    Compare predictions to real astrophysical data.
