# Detailed Theory of Time Waves in Black Holes

This document provides the theoretical background of the **time wave theory** and its implications for our understanding of black holes, cosmic evolution, and the structure of time itself.

## ðŸŒŒ Key Findings

### Matter as "Trapped Light"
Matter and energy are not separate entities; instead, they engage in a **recursive transformation** driven by time. This aligns with the concept of **pair production** where photons create matter and antimatter.

### Gravity as Energy Redistribution
Gravity is not a fundamental force, but rather, an emergent phenomenon resulting from **energy redistribution** across spacetime. This insight leads to a modified version of Einstein's field equations:

$$
G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} \left( T_{\mu\nu} + \frac{\partial E}{\partial t} \right)
$$

### Black Holes as Energy Recyclers
Black holes are not passive sinks but instead function as **energy recyclers**. This feedback mechanism contributes to cosmic equilibrium and may explain both the **information paradox** and the apparent **absence of dark matter**.

### Dark Energy as an Oscillation
Cosmic expansion is not driven by an unknown force (dark energy), but may instead arise as a **natural oscillation** within the cosmic energy cycle, represented by a dynamic cosmological constant:

$$
\Lambda(t) = \Lambda_0 e^{-t / \tau}
$$

## **Incorporating Time and Entropy into the Equations**

### Modified Einstein Field Equations
To account for the **dynamic nature of time**, the energy-momentum tensor can be expanded to include terms for **time release** and **entropy change** from black holes:

$$
G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} \left( T_{\mu\nu} + \frac{\partial E}{\partial t} + \Delta S_{\mu\nu} \right)
$$

This modification reflects the influence of **time release** and **entropy flux** associated with phenomena like Hawking radiation.

### Future Research
Future work will focus on **simulating** the feedback between time release, entropy dynamics, and black hole evolution. We will also explore how these effects contribute to the **acceleration of cosmic expansion** and the **emergence of dark energy**.
