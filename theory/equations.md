# Mathematical Derivations for Time Waves and Gravity Feedback

This document provides the core mathematical equations and derivations used in the time wave theory.

## **Modified Einstein Field Equations**
The revised Einstein field equations are:

$$
G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} \left( T_{\mu\nu} + \frac{\partial E}{\partial t} + \Delta S_{\mu\nu} \right)
$$

Where:
- $$\( T_{\mu\nu} \)$$ is the energy-momentum tensor,
- $$\( \frac{\partial E}{\partial t} \)$$ represents the energy flux due to the **time release**,
- $$\( \Delta S_{\mu\nu} \)$$ accounts for entropy flux, representing time-related entropy change.

### Time-Entropy Relationship
We propose that black holes release time, which is directly linked to **entropy**. The relationship is expressed as:

$$
\Delta S = k_B \ln \left( \frac{1}{1 - \frac{t}{t_{\text{max}}}} \right)
$$

Where:
- $$\( \Delta S \)$$ is the change in entropy,
- $$\( k_B \)$$ is the Boltzmann constant,
- $$\( t_{\text{max}} \)$$ is the characteristic time release rate.

### Dynamic Spacetime Curvature
The dynamic evolution of spacetime curvature includes the effects of **time release** and entropy changes:

$$
R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} R g_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} \left( T_{\mu\nu} + \frac{\partial E}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial \Delta S_{\mu\nu}}{\partial t} \right)
$$
